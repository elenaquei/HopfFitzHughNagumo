First step:
 numerically find a Hopf bifurcation for fixed epsilon in the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE (more info in the documentation of the FitzHugh-Nagumo code)
Second step:
 numerically continue the solution for other epsilons
Third step:
 validate the branch
  substep: prove it is not degenerate
Fourth step:
 conquer the world
